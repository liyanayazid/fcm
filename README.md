Create a Flutter app and set-up a project at the Firebase console. Prepare the app
(Android only) to receive push notifications and start sending messages from the
console. Print out the messages received and display them in either terminal or in Text
or pop-up dialogs widgets in a design of your liking.

Bonus: Use flutter_local_notifications plugin to display the push notifications and open a
new screen when the notification is clicked. That screen has an appbar with a title of
“Notifications” and shows the title and the body of the push notification.
